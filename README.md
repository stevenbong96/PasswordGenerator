Image to the HW included in the Assets folder

The overall scope for this HW is to utilize the function and for loop command inside the JS to enhance our knowledge in using JS. For this HW, students need to create a random Password Generator for users to help them create their own desire password. The password itself has to be random and consists of lower case, upper case, numbers, and symbols. Also, the length has to be desired by the users to determined. For this HW, I personally did step by step, which listed as below:
1. Start with defining the variables for the upper, lower, numbers, and symbols
2. Went to the tutor and review session with Ashlan to figure out the steps in doing this HW by writing the pseudo code into JS file
3. Start lining out the logic behind the password generator mechanism
4. Create prompt for user on which criteria that they would like to use in making the random password
5. Create another function to store the random array based on the user desire
6. Create for loop inside the new function based on the user specified length and run the loop to get a random array everytime the loop runs
7. Create a new variable to store the new random array
8. Store the new random array back to the first function to generate the random password and show it to the users
